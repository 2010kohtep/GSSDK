# GoldSrc SDK

Relatively full SDK for GoldSource renderer library.

# What is this?

GoldSrc SDK is a module written in Delphi and contains Half-Life 1 SDK translated from C++. Module also provides types that were not described in the original SDK.

Module is still not considered complete and may receive updates in the future. You can use this module to write your own projects for all games written on the GoldSource engine, including mods such as Counter-Strike 1.6.

The module is written in the RAD Studio 10 programming environment. Support for old Delphi versions (7) or alternative Delphi compilers (Lazarus, FPC, Kylix) is not planned.

# Why tho?

There are a couple of big Delphi projects that I have to support. To facilitate this task, this module was written. After a while, I decided to share it. Perhaps it will be useful to someone.
